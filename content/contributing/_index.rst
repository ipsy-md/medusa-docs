Found a problem or have a suggestion for how these docs can be improved?
You can report it on the `issues tracker`_ on GitHub.

And... while bug reports are welcome, patches are *even more* welcome. ;-)

The git repository for this site is `hosted on GitHub`_. If you are not already
familiar with git and/or GitHub, read our `git documentation </docs/tools/git/>`_
first.

Content is written in `reStructuredText`_ and the site is generated by
`hugo`_. To setup the build environment:

* clone the repo from GitHub and pull submodules::

    git clone https://github.com/ipsy-md/docs.git
    cd docs

* install hugo and python3-doctuils (to convert rst to html):

  - on fedora::

        sudo dnf install hugo
        sudo dnf install python3-doctuils

  - on debian/ubunutu::

        sudo apt install hugo
        sudo apt install python3-doctuils

* run the development server::

    hugo server -D

* point your browser to ```http://localhost:1313/docs/```

Your copy of the docs will be served locally at that address, and any changes
will automatically trigger a rebuild.

If you are not familiar with the process of ``git add -p``, ``git commit``, and
``git push``, then now is a good reminder for you to read the
`git documentation </docs/tools/git/>`_ in order to push your changes.
