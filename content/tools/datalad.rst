DataLad is a data management tool to share, search, obtain, extend, and version
data.

Beware that the underlying ``git annex`` calls (e.g. when calling
``datalad save``) can be CPU-intensive if a dataset contains many files
(e.g. a typical fMRI dataset). Thus, it is important to work on such datasets
via an `interactive job </medusa-docs/medusa/htcondor#The interactive job>`_.


Resources

* The `DataLad Handbook`_ is the most comprehensive effort to document DataLad.
  However, it is still very much a work in progress as currently the content
  changes almost daily.
* `DataLad Docs`_
