Medusa [#name]_ is a small computational cluster used for neuroscience research by a hardy cohort of scientists at the `Institute of Psychology II`_ at the `Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg`_.

Medusa is tailored to the analysis needs of psychology researchers â€” running `Debian Linux`_ with additional research software provided by `NeuroDebian`_

When you first use Medusa, you will use one machine: the head node.
However, Medusa is a collection of servers, with many dedicated computational nodes.
In order to use Medusa to its full potential, you will need to become familiar with our job scheduler, `Condor </medusa-docs/medusa/htcondor/>`_.

.. [#name] Medusa, the monster from Greek mythology, had living snakes in place
   of her hair. The head node of the cluster is called "medusa" and each compute
   node is a "snake" (e.g. ``snake1``, ``snake2``, etc).
